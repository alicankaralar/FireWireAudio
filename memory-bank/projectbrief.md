# Project Brief: FireWireAudio

## Core Goal
Develop a robust and reliable software solution for interacting with FireWire audio devices on macOS.

## Key Objectives
- Provide low-level access to FireWire audio device registers and functionalities.
- Enable discovery and identification of connected FireWire audio devices.
- Offer a C-API for integration with higher-level applications.
- Potentially include a user-facing control application for device management and monitoring.

## Scope
- Initial focus on TASCAM, DICE, and other common FireWire audio chipsets.
- macOS platform.
- C++ for core library, Swift/Objective-C for any UI components.

## Non-Goals (Initially)
- Support for operating systems other than macOS.
- Full audio streaming capabilities (focus on control and configuration first).
