## Linux DICE Driver (`ref/dice.c`) Insights

Analysis of the provided Linux kernel driver (`ref/dice.c`) reveals valuable information about DICE device support:

*   **Supported Vendors/OUIs:** The driver explicitly handles devices from:
    *   Weiss (0x001c6a)
    *   Loud (0x000ff2)
    *   Focusrite (0x00130e)
    *   TC Electronic (0x000166)
    *   Alesis (0x000595)
    *   M-Audio (0x000d6c)
    *   Mytek (0x001ee8)
    *   SSL (0x0050c2)
    *   Presonus (0x000a92)
    *   Harman (0x000fd7)
    *   Avid (0x00a07e)
*   **Device Identification:** Uses a combination of Vendor ID (Specifier ID), Model ID, and Category ID (from Config ROM) to identify devices.
*   **Device-Specific Logic:** Contains a table (`dice_id_table`) mapping specific Vendor/Model IDs to custom functions, primarily for detecting audio stream formats (e.g., `snd_dice_detect_tcelectronic_formats`, `snd_dice_detect_alesis_formats`, `snd_dice_detect_extension_formats`, `snd_dice_detect_mytek_formats`, `snd_dice_detect_presonus_formats`, `snd_dice_detect_harman_formats`, `snd_dice_detect_focusrite_pro40_tcd3070_formats`, `snd_dice_detect_weiss_formats`).
*   **Known Quirks:** Includes specific workarounds or flags for certain devices, such as disabling double PCM frames (`disable_double_pcm_frames = true`) for some M-Audio/Avid models and handling GUID inconsistencies for Focusrite Saffire Pro 40.

This information provides a reference point for understanding how these devices are handled in another OS environment and highlights potential complexities or device variations to consider in this project's implementation.

### libhitaki (Linux Userspace Library) Insights

*   **Purpose:** A GLib/GObject-based library for interacting with ALSA FireWire kernel drivers (`snd-firewire-lib`).
*   **Communication:** Uses the ALSA HwDep character device (`/dev/snd/hwC*D*`) interface, relying on ioctl calls for synchronous operations (locking, getting info) and reading the device file descriptor for asynchronous events (e.g., `SNDRV_FIREWIRE_EVENT_DICE_NOTIFICATION`).
*   **Relevance:** Provides an alternative implementation example (userspace + kernel driver via ioctl/events) compared to the direct IOKit approach used in this project. Highlights the event-based notification pattern used in Linux.

### FFADO (Linux Userspace Library) Insights (`ref/libffado-2.4.9`)

Analysis of the FFADO library source code provides another perspective on DICE interaction:

*   **Architecture:** FFADO is a C++ userspace library using `libraw1394` for direct FireWire communication (quadlet reads/writes, isochronous stream management, ARM notifications).
*   **Register Access:**
    *   FFADO dynamically determines the base addresses for the Global, Tx, and Rx register spaces by reading specific registers (`DICE_REGISTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETER_SPACE_OFFSET`, etc.) relative to a base pointer (`DICE_REGISTER_BASE = 0x0000FFFFE0000000ULL`).
    *   It then uses relative offsets defined in `dice_defines.h` to access registers *within* these dynamically located spaces.
*   **Register Offset Discrepancies (Spec vs. FFADO):** This dynamic base + relative offset approach leads to different effective offsets compared to the absolute offsets defined in the DICE specification PDF (relative to `0xFFFFF0000000`). Key examples:
    *   **GLOBAL_OWNER:** Spec: `0x04` | FFADO: `0x00` (relative to dynamic Global base)
    *   **GLOBAL_NOTIFICATION:** Spec: `0x88` (Owner space) | FFADO: `0x08` (relative to dynamic Global base)
    *   **GLOBAL_CLOCK_SELECT:** Spec: `0x20` | FFADO: `0x4C` (relative to dynamic Global base)
    *   **TX_ISOCHRONOUS_CHANNEL (Base):** Spec: `0x10C` | FFADO: `0x08` (relative to dynamic Tx base)
    *   **RX_ISOCHRONOUS_CHANNEL (Base):** Spec: `0x20C` | FFADO: `0x08` (relative to dynamic Rx base)
    *   **Note:** This difference is crucial and suggests relying solely on the specification's absolute offsets might be incorrect if the device expects interaction relative to dynamically discovered bases, as implemented in FFADO.
*   **Notifications:** Uses ARM handlers registered via `libraw1394`. The host provides a notification address via `GLOBAL_OWNER`, and the device writes notification codes there.
*   **Streaming:** Uses `AmdtpReceiveStreamProcessor` / `AmdtpTransmitStreamProcessor` (IEC 61883-6 AM824). Configures streams by writing the allocated ISO channel number to DICE Tx/Rx registers.
*   **Ownership:** Uses compare-and-swap on `GLOBAL_OWNER` via `libraw1394`'s `lockCompareSwap64` to claim ownership and register the ARM handler. Includes checks for conflicts with the `snd-dice` kernel driver.
*   **EAP Support:** Includes an `EAP` class for Extended Audio Protocol support.
*   **Device Specialization:** Uses C++ inheritance (`Dice::Device` base class) for device-specific implementations (e.g., `Focusrite::SaffirePro40`, `Maudio::Profire2626`).
