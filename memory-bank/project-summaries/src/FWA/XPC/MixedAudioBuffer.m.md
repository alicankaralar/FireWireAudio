# Summary for src/FWA/XPC/MixedAudioBuffer.m

This Objective-C file implements the `MixedAudioBuffer` class. This class is designed as a container to hold a chunk of audio data along with its associated metadata (format, timestamp, frame count), specifically for the purpose of sending it over XPC (Cross-Process Communication).

**Key Functionalities:**

-   **Data Encapsulation (Properties):**
    -   `audioData`: An `NSData` object that stores the raw audio sample data.
    -   `format`: An `AudioStreamBasicDescription` (ASBD) struct. This standard Core Audio struct describes the format of the audio data (e.g., sample rate, number of channels, bits per channel, format flags like float/integer, interleaved/non-interleaved).
    -   `timestamp`: A `uint64_t` which likely represents `AudioTimeStamp.mHostTime`, providing a timestamp for when the audio data was captured or should be played.
    -   `frameCount`: A `uint32_t` indicating the number of audio frames contained in `audioData`.

-   **Initialization:**
    -   `- (instancetype)initWithData:(NSData *)data format:(AudioStreamBasicDescription)format timestamp:(uint64_t)timestamp frameCount:(uint32_t)frameCount;`:
        -   The designated initializer. It takes all the necessary pieces of information to construct a `MixedAudioBuffer` object.

-   **Secure Coding (`NSSecureCoding` Protocol):**
    -   The class conforms to the `NSSecureCoding` protocol, which is essential for safely sending custom objects over XPC.
    -   `+ (BOOL)supportsSecureCoding`: Returns `YES`, indicating that the class supports secure encoding and decoding.
    -   `- (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder`:
        -   This method is called during serialization (e.g., when the object is being prepared for XPC transmission).
        -   It encodes each of its properties (`audioData`, the fields of the `format` ASBD, `timestamp`, `frameCount`) into the provided `NSCoder` archive.
    -   `- (nullable instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder`:
        -   This method is called during deserialization (e.g., when the object is received on the other side of an XPC connection).
        -   It decodes the properties from the `NSCoder` archive and uses them to initialize a new `MixedAudioBuffer` instance.
        -   It carefully decodes each field of the `AudioStreamBasicDescription` struct.

-   **Accessor Methods (Getters):**
    -   Provides public getter methods for its properties (e.g., `audioData`, `format`, `timestamp`, `frameCount`).

**Overall Role:**
The `MixedAudioBuffer` class serves as a standardized and secure way to package audio data and its critical metadata for transmission between different processes using XPC.
-   When the `FWADaemon` might need to send audio data to a client application (e.g., for metering in a GUI, or for an application that directly consumes audio from the daemon).
-   Potentially, if a client application were to send audio *to* the daemon for processing or output (though the primary flow seems to be driver -> daemon -> device).
By conforming to `NSSecureCoding`, it ensures that these custom objects can be safely passed through the XPC system, maintaining data integrity and type safety. This is a common pattern for sending structured data over XPC in macOS/iOS development.
