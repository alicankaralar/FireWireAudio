# Summary for src/FWA/IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery.cpp

This C++ file implements the `FWA::IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery` class. This class is responsible for detecting the connection and disconnection of FireWire devices on the macOS system using IOKit's notification mechanisms. It implements the `IFireWireDeviceDiscovery` interface.

**Key Functionalities:**

-   **Constructor and Destructor:**
    -   The constructor initializes member variables (like notification ports and iterators) to null or default states.
    -   The destructor calls `stop()` to ensure resources are released.

-   **Starting Discovery (`start`):**
    -   `void start(DeviceAddedCallback addedCb, DeviceRemovedCallback removedCb, void* context)`:
        -   Stores the provided `addedCb`, `removedCb` (C-style function pointers), and `context` (typically a pointer to the `DeviceController` instance). These callbacks will be invoked when devices are added or removed.
        -   Creates an `IONotificationPortRef` to receive IOKit notifications.
        -   Adds the notification port's run loop source to the current thread's `CFRunLoop`. This allows IOKit notifications to be processed asynchronously.
        -   **Matching Dictionary:** Creates a matching dictionary using `IOServiceMatching(kIOFireWireDeviceClassName)`. This tells IOKit to notify about instances of `IOFireWireDevice`.
        -   **Device Added Notification:** Calls `IOServiceAddMatchingNotification` to register for `kIOFirstMatchNotification`. This notification is triggered when a new device matching the dictionary appears. The static `sDeviceAdded` function is set as the callback.
        -   Calls `sDeviceAdded` manually once to iterate through already existing devices that match.
        -   **Device Removed Notification:** Calls `IOServiceAddMatchingNotification` to register for `kIOTerminatedNotification`. This notification is triggered when a matched device is terminated (disconnected). The static `sDeviceRemoved` function is set as the callback.

-   **Stopping Discovery (`stop`):**
    -   `void stop()`:
        -   Removes the notification port's run loop source from the run loop.
        -   Releases the notification iterators (`_matchedIterator`, `_terminatedIterator`) if they are valid.
        -   Disposes of the `IONotificationPortRef`.

-   **Static IOKit Callback Functions:**
    -   `static void sDeviceAdded(void* refCon, io_iterator_t iterator)`:
        -   This C-style function is called by IOKit when one or more matching devices are added.
        -   It iterates through the `iterator`, and for each `io_service_t` (representing a device):
            -   Casts `refCon` to `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery*` to get the instance.
            -   Calls the instance method `deviceAdded(service)`.
            -   Releases the `io_service_t` object.
    -   `static void sDeviceRemoved(void* refCon, io_iterator_t iterator)`:
        -   Similar to `sDeviceAdded`, but for device removal. Calls the instance method `deviceRemoved(service)`.

-   **Instance Callback Handler Methods:**
    -   `void deviceAdded(io_service_t service)`:
        -   If the `_deviceAddedCallback` is set, it calls this callback, passing the `service` object and the stored `_callbackContext`. This notifies the `DeviceController` (or other registered client) about the new device.
    -   `void deviceRemoved(io_service_t service)`:
        -   If the `_deviceRemovedCallback` is set, it calls this callback, notifying about the removed device.

**Overall Role:**
The `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery` class is the FWA library's interface to macOS's IOKit for detecting FireWire hardware. It encapsulates the setup of IOKit matching and notification mechanisms. When FireWire devices are plugged in or unplugged, IOKit triggers the registered static callbacks, which in turn call instance methods on `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery`. These instance methods then invoke the higher-level callbacks provided by the `DeviceController`, effectively bridging low-level IOKit events to the FWA library's device management logic.
