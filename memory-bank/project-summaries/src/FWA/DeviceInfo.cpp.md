# Summary for src/FWA/DeviceInfo.cpp

This C++ file implements the `FWA::DeviceInfo` class. This class serves as a data structure to aggregate and store various pieces of information about a specific FireWire audio device. This information is typically gathered from IOKit registry properties and by parsing the device's AV/C descriptors.

**Key Functionalities and Data Members:**

-   **Data Storage (Member Variables):**
    -   **Basic Identification:**
        -   `guid`: `uint64_t` storing the device's Global Unique Identifier.
        -   `name`: `std::string` for the device's main name (often model name).
        -   `vendorName`: `std::string` for the manufacturer's name.
        -   `modelName`: `std::string` for the specific model name.
    -   **Versioning:**
        -   `firmwareVersion`: `std::string` for the device's firmware version.
        -   `hardwareVersion`: `std::string` (though its population might depend on specific descriptor availability).
    -   **Serial Number:**
        -   `serialNumber`: `std::string`.
    -   **Subunit Information:**
        -   Pointers or embedded objects (e.g., `std::optional<AudioSubunitInfo>`, `std::optional<MusicSubunitInfo>`) to store parsed information from the Audio and Music subunits, if present. These nested structs would contain details specific to those subunit types.
    -   **Plug Information:**
        -   `inputPlugs`: `std::vector<AudioPlug>` storing details of all discovered input audio plugs.
        -   `outputPlugs`: `std::vector<AudioPlug>` storing details of all discovered output audio plugs.
    -   **Raw Descriptor Data (Optional Storage):**
        -   `unitInfoDescriptor`: `std::vector<uint8_t>` to store the raw bytes of the unit information descriptor.
        -   `audioSubunitDescriptor`: `std::vector<uint8_t>` for the raw audio subunit information descriptor.
        -   `musicSubunitDescriptor`: `std::vector<uint8_t>` for the raw music subunit information descriptor.
        -   (Potentially other raw descriptors could be stored as well).

-   **JSON Serialization (`toJson() const`):**
    -   This is a significant method that converts all the stored device information into a `nlohmann::json` object.
    -   It iterates through its member variables and adds corresponding key-value pairs to the JSON object.
    -   For complex members like `inputPlugs`, `outputPlugs`, `audioSubunitInfo`, and `musicSubunitInfo`, it would call their respective `toJson()` methods to get their JSON representations and include them as nested objects or arrays.
    -   Raw descriptor data (like `unitInfoDescriptor`) is typically converted to a hexadecimal string representation before being added to the JSON.
    -   The resulting JSON object provides a comprehensive, structured, and easily serializable/transmittable representation of the device's properties and capabilities. This is likely used by `AudioDevice::getDeviceInfoAsJson()`.

**Overall Role:**
The `DeviceInfo` class acts as a centralized container for all discovered and parsed information pertaining to a FireWire audio device. It is populated by classes like `DeviceParser` after reading and interpreting data from the device. An instance of `DeviceInfo` is typically held by an `AudioDevice` object. Its main purpose is to:
1.  Store a snapshot of the device's characteristics in a structured way.
2.  Provide an easy way to serialize this information (e.g., to JSON) for debugging, display in a GUI, or for communication with other processes.
