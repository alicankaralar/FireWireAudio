# Summary for src/FWA/SubunitDiscoverer.cpp

This C++ file implements the `FWA::SubunitDiscoverer` class. The purpose of this class is to discover the AV/C (Audio Video Control) subunits (e.g., Audio, Music, Vendor Unique) that are present on a FireWire device. It achieves this by reading and parsing the "Subunit Information" descriptors from the device's unit level.

**Key Functionalities:**

-   **Constructor (`SubunitDiscoverer::SubunitDiscoverer`):**
    -   Takes a `std::shared_ptr<DescriptorAccessor>` (used for reading raw descriptor data from the device) and an `std::shared_ptr<spdlog::logger>`.
    -   Stores these dependencies.

-   **Primary Discovery Method (`discoverSubunits`):**
    -   `std::expected<std::vector<SubunitIdentifier>, IOKitError> discoverSubunits(std::optional<SubunitType> typeToDiscover = std::nullopt) const`:
        -   This is the main method for discovering subunits.
        -   **Parameter:** `typeToDiscover` (optional): If provided, the method will only return subunits of this specific type. If `std::nullopt` (the default), it discovers all subunit types.
        -   **Read Subunit Information Descriptor List:**
            -   It calls `_descriptorAccessor->readSubunitInfoList()`. This method in `DescriptorAccessor` is responsible for reading the list of "subunit_info_descriptors" from the device's unit level. Each entry in this list typically contains the `subunit_type` and `subunit_id` for one subunit.
        -   **Iterate and Parse:**
            -   If the list is read successfully, it iterates through each raw subunit information descriptor data block in the returned vector.
            -   For each data block, it uses `DescriptorUtils::parseSubunitIdentifier(entryData, offset)` to extract the `subunit_type` and `subunit_id`.
            -   **Filtering:** If `typeToDiscover` was specified, it checks if the parsed `subunit_type` matches the requested type.
            -   If there's a match (or if no specific type was requested), it creates a `SubunitIdentifier` struct (which likely holds the type and ID) and adds it to a result vector.
        -   **Return Value:** Returns an `std::expected` containing a `std::vector<SubunitIdentifier>` (listing all discovered and filtered subunits) on success, or an `IOKitError` on failure.

-   **Convenience Discovery Methods:**
    -   `std::expected<std::vector<SubunitIdentifier>, IOKitError> discoverAudioSubunits() const`:
        -   A helper method that simply calls `discoverSubunits(SubunitType::Audio)` to find only Audio subunits.
    -   `std::expected<std::vector<SubunitIdentifier>, IOKitError> discoverMusicSubunits() const`:
        -   A helper method that calls `discoverSubunits(SubunitType::Music)` to find only Music (MIDI) subunits.
    -   (Similar methods could exist for other specific subunit types if needed).

**Overall Role:**
The `SubunitDiscoverer` class is a key component in the initial phase of understanding a FireWire device's architecture. It is used by the `AudioDevice` class (during its `init()` process) to determine what types of functional subunits are present on the device and what their IDs are. Once the `SubunitIdentifier`s are obtained, the `AudioDevice` can then create specific subunit objects (like `AudioSubunit` or `MusicSubunit`) and delegate further descriptor parsing and control to those objects. This class abstracts the process of iterating through the subunit table in the device's configuration ROM.
