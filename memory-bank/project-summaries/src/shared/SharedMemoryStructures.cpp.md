# Summary for src/shared/SharedMemoryStructures.cpp

This C++ file is extremely brief and primarily serves as a compilation unit for the definitions contained in its corresponding header file, `shared/SharedMemoryStructures.hpp`.

**Observed Content:**

-   The file consists of a single line:
    `#include <shared/SharedMemoryStructures.hpp>`

**Inferred Purpose and Functionality:**

1.  **Include Wrapper:** Its main purpose is to include the `shared/SharedMemoryStructures.hpp` header file. This header file (which we've previously established is the same as `src/driver/SharedMemoryStructures.hpp`) contains the crucial definitions for:
    -   The `RTShmRing` namespace.
    -   The `AudioChunk_POD` struct (for audio data and timestamps).
    -   The `ControlBlock_POD` struct (with atomic `readCount` and `writeCount` for the SPSC ring buffer).
    -   The `SharedRingBuffer_POD` struct (the overall layout for shared memory).
    -   The inline `push()` and `pop()` functions for the lock-free SPSC queue.

2.  **Compilation Unit:**
    -   Even if the included header file (`SharedMemoryStructures.hpp`) contains only inline functions and struct/class definitions (which is largely the case here), having a corresponding `.cpp` file that includes it can be a practice to ensure that:
        -   If any non-inline static members or global non-inline functions were ever added to the header, they would have a single translation unit for their definition, preventing linker errors.
        -   Some build systems or coding styles prefer having a `.cpp` file for every significant `.hpp` file, even if it's just an include wrapper, for organizational purposes or to ensure the header is self-contained and compiles.
    -   In this specific case, since `SharedMemoryStructures.hpp` contains inline functions and POD struct definitions, this `.cpp` file itself doesn't contribute new executable code but ensures that the contents of the header are processed by the compiler as part of the `FWA` library (or whichever target includes this source file).

**Overall Role:**
[`src/shared/SharedMemoryStructures.cpp`](src/shared/SharedMemoryStructures.cpp:1) acts as a placeholder or a formal compilation unit for the shared memory data structures and algorithms defined in `shared/SharedMemoryStructures.hpp`. The actual logic and definitions reside in the header file.
