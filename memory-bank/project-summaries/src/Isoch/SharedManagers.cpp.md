# Summary for src/Isoch/SharedManagers.cpp

This C++ file, in conjunction with its header `SharedManagers.hpp`, is intended to provide a centralized point of access to various singleton manager objects within the `FWA::Isoch` (isochronous streaming) module.

**Observed Content:**

-   The `.cpp` file itself only contains `#include "SharedManagers.hpp"`.

**Inferred Purpose and Functionality (based on typical design patterns and the name):**

The `SharedManagers.hpp` header file would likely define or declare static methods or global accessor functions that return singleton instances of key manager classes used throughout the isochronous streaming subsystem. These managers could include:

-   **`IsochTransportManager`**: A manager responsible for the overall orchestration of isochronous transport, possibly handling the allocation of FireWire bus resources like isochronous channels and bandwidth.
-   **`RunLoopHelper`**: A utility to manage integration with `CFRunLoop` for asynchronous IOKit operations related to isochronous streaming (e.g., DCL completion callbacks).
-   **`IsochDCLManager` (and/or `IsochTransmitDCLManager`, `IsochReceiveDCLManager`):** Managers for IOKit Data Command Lists (DCLs), which are used to describe data buffers for isochronous I/O operations.
-   **`IsochBufferManager` (and/or `IsochTransmitBufferManager`, `IsochReceiveBufferManager`):** Managers for the actual data buffers used in isochronous streaming, potentially handling allocation, pooling, and lifecycle.
-   **Other specialized managers** as needed by the isochronous framework.

**Overall Role:**

The `SharedManagers` component (header and minimal cpp) serves to:
1.  **Provide Singleton Access:** Ensure that there is only one instance of each critical manager class within the isochronous subsystem.
2.  **Centralize Dependencies:** Offer a common place for other classes within the `FWA::Isoch` module (like `AudioDeviceStream`, `AmdtpTransmitter`, `AmdtpReceiver`) to obtain references to these shared manager services. This avoids a complex web of direct dependencies or manual passing of manager instances.
3.  **Manage Lifecycle (Potentially):** The singletons might be initialized on first access or through an explicit initialization function called by `SharedManagers`.

By having a minimal `.cpp` file, it suggests that most of the implementation for accessing these singletons (e.g., static member definitions or inline getter functions returning static local instances) is contained within the `SharedManagers.hpp` header file. This is a common pattern for simple singleton accessors.
