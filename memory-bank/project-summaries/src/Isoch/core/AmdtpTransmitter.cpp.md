# Summary for src/Isoch/core/AmdtpTransmitter.cpp

This C++ file implements the `FWA::Isoch::AmdtpTransmitter` class. This class is responsible for the critical task of taking raw audio data and formatting it into AMDT-P (Audio and Music Data Transmission Protocol) packets. These packets are then ready for transmission over a FireWire isochronous channel. It adheres to the IEC 61883-6 standard for AMDT-P.

**Key Functionalities:**

-   **Constructor (`AmdtpTransmitter::AmdtpTransmitter`):**
    -   Takes parameters necessary for AMDT-P packetization:
        -   The `AudioStreamFormat` of the audio data (sample rate, bit depth, number of channels).
        -   `sytInterval`: The interval (e.g., in milliseconds or number of packets) at which SYT (timestamp) fields should be embedded in the CIP headers.
        -   `dataBlockCountPerPacket`: The number of audio data blocks to include in each AMDT-P packet.
        -   An `spdlog::logger`.
    -   Initializes internal state variables:
        -   Calculates `_dataBlockSize` (DBS) based on the audio format (e.g., for 24-bit stereo, DBS would be 6 bytes).
        -   Sets the initial Data Block Counter (`_dbc`) to 0.
        -   Initializes SYT-related counters and flags.
        -   Stores the audio format and other configuration parameters.

-   **Packetization (`generatePackets` or `processAudioChunk`):**
    -   `std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>> generatePackets(const void* audioData, size_t audioDataSizeBytes, uint64_t timestamp)`:
        -   This is the main method that takes a chunk of raw audio data, its size, and a presentation `timestamp`.
        -   It processes this audio data and generates one or more AMDT-P packets.
        -   **For each AMDT-P packet to be generated:**
            1.  **CIP Header Construction:**
                -   Sets the Source Packet Header (SPH) flag (usually `true` for audio).
                -   Sets the Data Block Count (DBC), incrementing it for each data block.
                -   Sets the Format Dependent Field (FDF):
                    -   For audio, this includes encoding the number of audio channels and potentially other format-specific bits.
                    -   If no actual audio data is being sent in this packet (e.g., to maintain timing or indicate silence), specific FDF bits are set accordingly (e.g., "label" field in AMDT-P).
                -   **SYT (Timestamp) Handling:**
                    -   Determines if an SYT field needs to be included in the current CIP header based on the `_sytInterval` and internal counters.
                    -   If so, it embeds the provided `timestamp` (or a calculated future timestamp) into the SYT field of the CIP header.
            2.  **Data Block Assembly:**
                -   Copies the appropriate number of audio data blocks (each of size `_dataBlockSize`) from the input `audioData` into the AMDT-P packet's payload.
                -   Handles cases where the input audio data might not perfectly fill the last packet, potentially padding or sending a partially filled packet as per AMDT-P rules.
            3.  **Packet Finalization:** Assembles the CIP header and the data blocks into a complete AMDT-P packet (a `std::vector<uint8_t>`).
        -   Returns a vector of these generated AMDT-P packets.

-   **"No Data" Packet Generation:**
    -   If `generatePackets` is called with no audio data (or if an internal buffer runs dry but a packet must be sent for timing), it generates AMDT-P packets with appropriate FDF flags indicating "no data" or "label" packets, ensuring the isochronous stream continuity.

-   **State Management:**
    -   Maintains the current Data Block Counter (`_dbc`).
    -   Tracks when the next SYT timestamp needs to be sent.
    -   Manages any internal buffering of audio data if the input chunks don't align perfectly with packet boundaries.

**Overall Role:**
The `AmdtpTransmitter` is a fundamental building block for sending audio over FireWire. It takes a stream of raw audio samples and meticulously transforms it into a sequence of AMDT-P packets, complete with CIP headers, correct data block counts, and embedded SYT timestamps for synchronization. These packets are then consumed by an `ITransmitPacketProvider` (like `IsochPacketProvider`, often managed by `AmdtpTransmitStreamProcessor`), which queues them for transmission by the IOKit FireWire stack. This class ensures that the audio data conforms to the IEC 61883-6 standard for interoperability.
