# Summary for src/Isoch/utils/RunLoopHelper.cpp

This C++ file implements the `FWA::Isoch::RunLoopHelper` class. This utility class is designed to create and manage a dedicated `std::thread` whose sole purpose is to run a CoreFoundation `CFRunLoop`. This is a common pattern in macOS/iOS development when dealing with asynchronous IOKit operations, as many IOKit callbacks and event sources need to be scheduled on a run loop to be processed.

**Key Functionalities:**

-   **Singleton Pattern (`instance()`):**
    -   Provides a static `instance()` method for global access to the single `RunLoopHelper` object. This ensures that all components using it share the same dedicated run loop thread.

-   **Dedicated Run Loop Thread Management:**
    -   **Constructor (`RunLoopHelper::RunLoopHelper`):**
        -   When the singleton instance is first created, it typically calls `start()` or performs the thread creation logic directly.
    -   **`start()` (or equivalent logic in constructor):**
        -   Checks if the run loop thread is already running.
        -   If not, it creates a new `std::thread` (`_runLoopThread`).
        -   The function executed by this new thread is typically a private instance method like `runLoopThreadFunc()`.
    -   **`runLoopThreadFunc()` (private instance method):**
        -   This function is the entry point for the dedicated thread.
        -   It gets the current `CFRunLoop` for this thread using `CFRunLoopGetCurrent()`.
        -   It stores this `CFRunLoopRef` in a member variable (e.g., `_runLoop`).
        -   **Crucially, it adds a "port" source or a timer source to the run loop.** A `CFRunLoop` will exit immediately if it has no sources or timers to monitor. A common way to keep it alive is to add a `CFMachPortRef` as a source.
        -   It then enters the main run loop execution by calling `CFRunLoopRun()`. This call will block until `CFRunLoopStop()` is called on this specific run loop.
    -   **`stop()`:**
        -   If the run loop and thread are active:
            -   Calls `CFRunLoopStop(_runLoop)` to signal the run loop on the dedicated thread to exit its `CFRunLoopRun()` call.
            -   If `_runLoopThread.joinable()`, it calls `_runLoopThread.join()` to wait for the thread to terminate cleanly.
    -   **Destructor (`RunLoopHelper::~RunLoopHelper`):**
        -   Calls `stop()` to ensure the thread is properly shut down when the `RunLoopHelper` singleton is destroyed (typically at program exit).

-   **Accessing the Run Loop:**
    -   `CFRunLoopRef getRunLoop() const`:
        -   Returns the `CFRunLoopRef` (`_runLoop`) of the dedicated thread.
        -   This allows other components (like `IsochDCLManager`, `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery`, or any class using `IOCommandGate`) to schedule their event sources (e.g., `CFRunLoopSourceRef` from an `IONotificationPortRef` or an `IOCommandGate`) on this specific run loop.

-   **Performing Blocks on the Run Loop Thread:**
    -   `void performBlock(std::function<void()> block)`:
        -   Takes a `std::function<void()>` (a C++ callable).
        -   Uses `CFRunLoopPerformBlock(_runLoop, kCFRunLoopCommonModes, ^{ block(); })` to schedule the C++ block to be executed on the dedicated run loop thread.
        -   This is useful for ensuring that operations that need to interact with IOKit objects or state managed on that thread are executed safely in the correct context.

**Overall Role:**
The `RunLoopHelper` provides a dedicated, managed `CFRunLoop` running on its own thread. This is essential for the `FWA::Isoch` module because:
1.  **Asynchronous IOKit Callbacks:** IOKit often uses callbacks for asynchronous operations (e.g., DCL completions for isochronous streams, device notifications). These callbacks need to be dispatched on a run loop.
2.  **Thread Safety:** By processing these callbacks on a dedicated thread, it avoids blocking the main application thread or other critical threads.
3.  **Centralized Event Processing:** It provides a single, known run loop where all isochronous-related asynchronous events can be scheduled and processed, simplifying thread management for the rest of the isochronous subsystem.
Components like `IsochDCLManager` would use `RunLoopHelper::instance().getRunLoop()` to schedule their IOKit event sources.
