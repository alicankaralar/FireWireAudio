# Summary for src/driver/DriverXPCManager.hpp

This header file defines the `FWA::DriverXPCManager` C++ class, designed to manage XPC (Cross-Process Communication) from the kernel-level driver to a user-space daemon. It follows a singleton pattern.

**Key Responsibilities and Features:**

-   **Singleton Access:** Provides a static `instance()` method to get the single global instance of the manager.
-   **XPC Connection Management:**
    -   `connectToDaemon()`: Initiates an XPC connection to the user-space daemon (service name likely `net.mrmidi.FWADaemon`).
    -   `disconnectFromDaemon()`: Terminates the XPC connection.
    -   `isConnected()`: Checks the current connection status.
-   **Communication with Daemon:**
    -   `getSharedMemoryName(std::function<void(const std::string&)> callback)`: Asynchronously requests the name of the shared memory segment from the daemon. The result is provided via a callback.
    -   `sendControlCommand(uint32_t commandID, const std::map<std::string, std::string>& params, std::function<void(bool, const std::map<std::string, std::string>&)> callback)`: Sends a generic control command to the daemon with parameters and receives a reply via callback.
    -   `notifyDeviceStatusChanged(uint64_t deviceGUID, bool isConnected, bool isInitialized, const std::string& deviceName, const std::string& vendorName)`: Sends device status updates (connection, initialization, name, vendor) to the daemon.
    -   `notifyDriverPresence(bool isPresent)`: Informs the daemon about the driver's presence (loaded/unloaded).
    -   `forwardLogMessageToDaemon(int level, const std::string& message)`: Sends log messages from the driver to the daemon.
-   **Internal XPC Handling:**
    -   It would internally use `NSXPCConnection` (or a C++ wrapper if not directly using Objective-C++ in the header) to manage the connection.
    -   It would define or use an XPC protocol (like `FWADaemonControlProtocol`) to interact with the remote daemon object.
    -   Handles XPC connection interruption and invalidation.
-   **Thread Safety:** Likely uses a mutex (`xpcMutex_`) to protect access to shared XPC-related resources.
-   **Private Members (Implied):**
    -   `xpc_connection_t xpcConnection_`: The underlying XPC connection object.
    -   `dispatch_queue_t xpcQueue_`: A dispatch queue for XPC event handling.
    -   `std::string daemonShmName_`: To store the retrieved shared memory name.
    -   `bool connected_`: Connection status flag.

This class acts as the driver's primary interface for communicating configuration, status, and control requests to its user-space daemon counterpart, facilitating operations that cannot or should not be done directly in kernel space (like shared memory setup notifications or complex device state management that might involve GUI interaction).
