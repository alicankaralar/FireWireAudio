# Summary for src/driver/DriverXPCManager.mm

This Objective-C++ file implements the `FWA::DriverXPCManager` class, which is responsible for managing the XPC communication from the driver (kernel space) to the user-space daemon (`net.mrmidi.FWADaemon`).

**Key Functionalities:**

-   **Singleton Pattern:**
    -   The `instance()` static method provides global access to a single `DriverXPCManager` object.

-   **XPC Connection Lifecycle:**
    -   `connectToDaemon()`:
        -   Creates an `NSXPCConnection` to the daemon using the Mach service name `"net.mrmidi.FWADaemon"`.
        -   Sets the `remoteObjectInterface` to `FWADaemonControlProtocol` (defined in `shared/xpc/FWADaemonControlProtocol.h`).
        -   Sets up `interruptionHandler` and `invalidationHandler` to log connection issues and attempt reconnection if configured.
        -   Resumes the connection.
        -   Calls `notifyDriverPresence(true)` to inform the daemon that the driver is active.
    -   `disconnectFromDaemon()`:
        -   Calls `notifyDriverPresence(false)`.
        -   Invalidates the `_xpcConnection`.
    -   `isConnected()`: Returns the status of the connection.

-   **Communication with Daemon (via `FWADaemonControlProtocol`):**
    -   `getSharedMemoryName(std::function<void(const std::string&)> callback)`:
        -   Asynchronously calls the `getSharedMemoryNameWithReply:` method on the daemon's remote proxy.
        -   The reply block from the daemon (containing the shared memory name as an `NSString*`) is processed:
            -   The name is converted to `std::string`.
            -   The provided C++ `callback` is invoked with the name.
            -   The name is cached in `_daemonShmName`.
    -   `sendControlCommand(...)`: (Stubbed) Intended to send generic control commands.
    -   `notifyDeviceStatusChanged(...)`: (Stubbed) Intended to send device status updates.
    -   `notifyDriverPresence(bool isPresent)`:
        -   Calls `setDriverPresenceStatus:isPresent` on the daemon's remote proxy.
    -   `forwardLogMessageToDaemon(int level, const std::string& message)`:
        -   Calls `forwardLogMessageFromDriver:level message:message` on the daemon's remote proxy.

-   **Thread Safety and Dispatch:**
    -   Uses a `dispatch_queue_t _xpcQueue` (serial) for managing XPC connection events and calls.
    -   A `std::mutex _xpcMutex` is used to protect access to shared members like `_xpcConnection` and `_connected`.

-   **Error Handling and Logging:**
    -   Uses `os_log` for logging XPC events, errors, and status changes.
    -   Includes basic retry logic in `connectToDaemon()` if the initial connection fails.

**Overall Role:**
The `DriverXPCManager` acts as the dedicated XPC client within the driver's user-space component (though this code runs in the driver process, it's user-space XPC). It establishes and maintains communication with the `FWADaemon`, primarily to:
1.  Obtain the name of the shared memory segment used for audio data transfer.
2.  Notify the daemon of the driver's operational status (presence).
3.  Forward log messages from the driver to the daemon (which might then relay them to a GUI).
4.  (Potentially) send other control commands or device status updates.

This class is crucial for the coordination between the kernel-level driver operations and the user-space daemon.
