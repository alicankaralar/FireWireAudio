# Summary for include/FWA/AVCInfoBlock.hpp

This C++ header file defines the `FWA::AVCInfoBlock` class. This class is designed to parse and represent an AV/C (Audio Video Control) "INFO block" descriptor. INFO blocks are a standard part of the AV/C descriptor mechanism and are used to provide textual information, such as human-readable names for units, subunits, plugs, or other device features.

**Key Declarations and Components:**

-   **Namespace `FWA`:** The class is defined within the `FWA` namespace.

-   **Includes:**
    -   `<string>`: For `std::string`.
    -   `<vector>`: For `std::vector<uint8_t>` to hold raw descriptor data.
    -   `<cstdint>`: For `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`.
    -   `<optional>`: For `std::optional` (e.g., for the optional language code).
    -   `<nlohmann/json.hpp>`: For JSON serialization.
    -   (Potentially character encoding conversion utilities if supporting more than ASCII/UTF-8 directly).

-   **Class `AVCInfoBlock`:**
    -   **Public Interface:**
        -   **Constructor:**
            -   `AVCInfoBlock(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data);`
            -   Takes a constant reference to a vector of bytes (`data`) which represents the raw data of an INFO block descriptor read from the device.
            -   The constructor itself (or a private `parse()` method called by it) is responsible for parsing this raw data.
        -   **Accessors (Getters):**
            -   `uint8_t getInfoBlockType() const;`: Returns the type of information contained in the block (e.g., name, version string, etc., as defined by AV/C).
            -   `uint16_t getCharacterSet() const;`: Returns the character set identifier (e.g., ASCII, ISO Latin-1, UTF-8, UTF-16). This is crucial for correctly interpreting the `text_data`.
            -   `std::optional<uint16_t> getLanguageCode() const;`: Returns the ISO 639 language code if present in the INFO block, otherwise `std::nullopt`.
            -   `const std::string& getText() const;`: Returns the decoded textual information as a `std::string`. The parsing logic must handle conversion from the specified `character_set`.
            -   `bool isValid() const;`: Returns `true` if the INFO block data was successfully parsed and is considered valid, `false` otherwise.
        -   **JSON Serialization:**
            -   `nlohmann::json toJson() const;`: Converts the parsed INFO block data (type, character set, language code, and text) into a `nlohmann::json` object.

    -   **Private Members (Conceptual - implementation details in .cpp):**
        -   `_infoBlockType`: `uint8_t`.
        -   `_characterSet`: `uint16_t`.
        -   `_languageCode`: `std::optional<uint16_t>`.
        -   `_text`: `std::string`.
        -   `_isValid`: `bool`.

    -   **Parsing Logic (within constructor or private `parse` method):**
        -   The core logic involves iterating through the `data` vector according to the AV/C INFO block descriptor structure.
        -   It extracts the `info_block_type`, `character_set`, and (if present) `language_code` fields.
        -   The remaining bytes constitute the `text_data`.
        -   **Character Set Conversion:** A significant part of the parsing logic is to convert the `text_data` from its original `character_set` (e.g., UTF-16BE which is common in AV/C) into a `std::string` (which is typically UTF-8 in modern C++). This might involve using platform-specific APIs or a third-party library for robust character encoding conversion if character sets beyond simple ASCII or UTF-8 are to be supported.
        -   Sets `_isValid` based on the success of parsing and data integrity.

**Overall Role:**
The `AVCInfoBlock` class provides a convenient way to handle textual information embedded within AV/C descriptors. When a descriptor parser (like `DeviceParser` or `PlugDetailParser`) encounters a reference to an INFO block (e.g., a `descriptor_type` of 0x0C and a `descriptor_id` pointing to the INFO block), it reads the raw INFO block data and passes it to an `AVCInfoBlock` object. This object then parses the block and makes the extracted text (e.g., a device name, plug name, or vendor string) easily accessible as a `std::string`, abstracting away the complexities of character set handling. This is essential for presenting user-friendly information about the FireWire device.
