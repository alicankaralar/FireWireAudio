# Summary for include/FWA/DeviceDiscoverySolution.h

This C++ header file defines the `FWA::DeviceDiscoverySolution` class. This class serves as a concrete implementation of the `IFireWireDeviceDiscovery` interface, specifically using `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery` as its underlying mechanism for detecting FireWire devices.

**Key Declarations and Components:**

-   **Namespace `FWA`:** The class is defined within the `FWA` namespace.

-   **Includes:**
    -   `"IFireWireDeviceDiscovery.h"`: For the `IFireWireDeviceDiscovery` interface that this class implements.
    -   `"IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery.h"`: For the `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery` class, which provides the actual IOKit-based discovery logic.
    -   `<memory>`: For `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`.
    -   `<spdlog/spdlog.h>`: For logging.

-   **Class `DeviceDiscoverySolution` (implements `IFireWireDeviceDiscovery`):**
    -   **Public Interface:**
        -   **Constructor:**
            -   `explicit DeviceDiscoverySolution(std::shared_ptr<spdlog::logger> logger);`
            -   Takes a logger as a dependency.
            -   Inside the constructor (in the `.cpp` file), it would create an instance of `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery`:
                `_iokitDiscovery = std::make_unique<IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery>(logger);` (or pass the logger to `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery` if its constructor takes one).
        -   **`IFireWireDeviceDiscovery` Interface Methods (Overrides):**
            -   `void start(DeviceAddedCallback addedCb, DeviceRemovedCallback removedCb, void* context) override;`
                -   This method delegates the call directly to the `start` method of its internal `_iokitDiscovery` object:
                    `_iokitDiscovery->start(addedCb, removedCb, context);`
            -   `void stop() override;`
                -   This method delegates the call directly to the `stop` method of its internal `_iokitDiscovery` object:
                    `_iokitDiscovery->stop();`

    -   **Private Members:**
        -   `std::unique_ptr<IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery> _iokitDiscovery;`: Holds the instance of the IOKit-based discovery mechanism.
        -   `std::shared_ptr<spdlog::logger> _logger;`: Stores the logger instance.

**Overall Role:**
The `DeviceDiscoverySolution` class acts as a concrete strategy for discovering FireWire devices, fulfilling the contract defined by the `IFireWireDeviceDiscovery` interface. It essentially wraps an `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery` object.
-   **Strategy Pattern:** This design allows the `DeviceController` to be programmed against the `IFireWireDeviceDiscovery` interface. While this specific class hardcodes the use of `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery`, the pattern would allow for other discovery mechanisms to be implemented in the future (e.g., a mock discovery for testing, or a different OS-specific mechanism if the library were ported) without changing the `DeviceController`'s core logic, simply by providing a different concrete implementation of `IFireWireDeviceDiscovery`.
-   **Delegation:** Its primary role is to delegate the `start` and `stop` calls to the underlying `IOKitFireWireDeviceDiscovery` instance.
The `DeviceController` would typically create an instance of `DeviceDiscoverySolution` (or be given one) to handle the actual device detection process.
