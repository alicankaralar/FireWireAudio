# Summary for include/xpc/FWADaemon/FWADaemonProtocol.h

This Objective-C header file appears to be an **obsolete or unused** attempt to define an XPC protocol for the `FWADaemon`. The entire content of the file is commented out.

**Key Observations:**

-   **Completely Commented Out:**
    ```objectivec
    // #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    //
    // // Protocol for the XPC service that the driver and GUI will talk to.
    // @protocol FWADaemonProtocol <NSObject>
    //
    // // Example method: Get daemon version
    // - (void)getVersionWithReply:(void (^)(NSString *version))reply;
    //
    // // Client registration
    // - (void)registerClient:(NSString *)clientID withEndpoint:(NSXPCListenerEndpoint *)endpoint;
    // - (void)unregisterClient:(NSString *)clientID;
    //
    // // Communication with driver
    // - (void)sendMessageToDriver:(NSDictionary *)message;
    //
    // // Communication to a specific client (e.g., GUI)
    // // This might actually be part of a client-side protocol the daemon calls
    // // - (void)notifyClient:(NSString *)clientID withMessage:(NSDictionary *)message;
    //
    // @end
    ```

-   **Intended Purpose (Based on Comments):**
    -   The comments suggest it was meant to define the interface for the XPC service that both the driver's user-space component and GUI applications would communicate with.
    -   The commented-out methods hint at functionalities like:
        -   Getting the daemon's version.
        -   Client registration and unregistration (passing an `NSXPCListenerEndpoint` for callbacks).
        -   Sending messages to the driver.
        -   A method for the daemon to notify a specific client (though the comment correctly notes this would typically be part of a client-side protocol that the client exports and the daemon calls).

-   **Actual Protocol Used in the Project:**
    -   The project actually uses `FWADaemonControlProtocol.h` (located in `include/shared/xpc/`) to define the methods that clients can call on the `FWADaemon`.
    -   It also uses `FWAClientNotificationProtocol.h` (in `include/shared/xpc/`) to define the methods that the `FWADaemon` can call back on its registered clients.

**Conclusion:**
This specific file, [`include/xpc/FWADaemon/FWADaemonProtocol.h`](include/xpc/FWADaemon/FWADaemonProtocol.h:1), in its current commented-out state, **does not define an active XPC protocol** used by the system. It appears to be an earlier draft or an abandoned approach. The functional XPC communication contracts are defined in `FWADaemonControlProtocol.h` and `FWAClientNotificationProtocol.h`. This file can likely be ignored or removed unless there's a historical reason for keeping it as commented-out code.
