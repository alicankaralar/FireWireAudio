[2025-05-03 08:09:20] - Current Focus: Investigating `kIOReturnNotResponding` (-536838121) error encountered when using `IOFireWireDeviceInterface::ReadQuadlet` in the 0xFFFFF0... address range on Midas Venice.
[2025-05-03 08:09:20] - Recent Changes: Confirmed DICE base address is 0xFFFFF0000000 via Config ROM key 0xD1 in `firewire_scanner.cpp`. Reads at this base and CSR addresses still fail.
[2025-05-03 08:09:20] - Open Questions/Issues: Why does `ReadQuadlet` fail with `kIOReturnNotResponding` in this specific address range? Is it permissions, device state, IOKit bug, or required alternative function? Inconclusive search of provided `libffado` source.
---
[2025-05-03 08:16:03] - Current Focus: Planning the refactoring of `src/tools/firewire_scanner.cpp` into smaller files (<250 lines) within `src/tools/scanner/` to improve maintainability and LLM context management.
[2025-05-03 08:16:03] - Recent Changes: Task shifted from debugging `kIOReturnNotResponding` to refactoring the scanner tool first.
[2025-05-03 08:16:03] - Open Questions/Issues: Awaiting user approval of the proposed refactoring plan.
---
[2025-05-03 08:44:47] - Current Focus: Resuming investigation into `kIOReturnNotResponding` (-536838121) error encountered when using `IOFireWireDeviceInterface::ReadQuadlet` in the 0xFFFFF0... address range on Midas Venice.
[2025-05-03 08:44:47] - Recent Changes: Successfully refactored `firewire_scanner` tool into smaller files within `src/tools/scanner/`. Updated CMakeLists.txt and confirmed successful build. Removed original `src/tools/firewire_scanner.cpp`.
[2025-05-03 08:44:47] - Open Questions/Issues: Why does `ReadQuadlet` fail with `kIOReturnNotResponding` in this specific address range? Is it permissions, device state, IOKit bug, or required alternative function?
---
[2025-05-03 11:23:43] - Current Focus: Testing if `kIOReturnNotResponding` is a permissions issue by running `firewire_scanner` with `sudo`.
[2025-05-03 11:23:43] - Next Steps: Switch to Code mode to execute `./firewire_scanner` in `src/tools/`. Analyze results.
---
[2025-05-03 12:59:59] - Current Focus: Investigating the root cause of `kIOReturnNotResponding` (-536838121) when using `IOFireWireDeviceInterface::ReadQuadlet` for CSR (e.g., 0xfffff000000c) and DICE register (e.g., 0xfffff0000480) reads via the `firewire_scanner` tool.
[2025-05-03 12:59:59] - Recent Changes: Successfully debugged and corrected Config ROM parsing logic in `src/tools/scanner/config_rom.cpp`. Confirmed correct DICE base address (`0xfffff0000420`) is now discovered. Confirmed `kIOReturnNotResponding` persists even with correct base address and without `sudo`. Confirmed `ReadQuadlet` is the intended function for this project, not alternatives suggested by `libffado` (which isn't a macOS driver).
[2025-05-03 12:59:59] - Open Questions/Issues: Why does `ReadQuadlet` fail with `kIOReturnNotResponding` specifically for CSR/DICE ranges? (Possibilities: IOKit limitations/usage nuances, device state).
[2025-05-03 12:59:59] - Next Steps: Research Apple documentation and examples for `IOFireWireDeviceInterface::ReadQuadlet` usage, focusing on accessing CSR and device-specific memory ranges on macOS.

[2025-05-03 14:16:21] - Current Focus: Enhancing development environment capabilities by adding MCP servers.
[2025-05-03 14:16:21] - Recent Changes: Added three MCP servers to Roo Code environment: browser-tools (for browser interaction), browser-use (for web browsing and content extraction), and sequential-thinking (for complex problem-solving through structured thinking).
[2025-05-03 14:16:21] - Next Steps: Continue investigating the `kIOReturnNotResponding` issue with enhanced tools at our disposal.
---
[2025-05-03 14:21:20] - Current Focus: Expanding the development environment capabilities with a comprehensive set of MCP servers.
[2025-05-03 14:21:20] - Recent Changes: Added 10 additional MCP servers to Roo Code environment: filesystem (file operations), github (GitHub API), git (Git operations), playwright (browser automation), fetch (web requests), apple-tools (Apple system integration), desktop-commander (terminal and file editing), slack (Slack integration), brave-search (web search), and xcodebuild (Xcode project management).
[2025-05-03 14:26:46] - Recent Changes: Added 10 more specialized MCP servers: firecrawl (web scraping), puppeteer (browser automation), context7 (context management), knowledge-graph and memento (memory systems), think-tank (reasoning), web-research and deep-research (web search and analysis), ollama (local LLM integration), and graphlit (knowledge graph tools).
[2025-05-03 14:26:46] - Next Steps: Leverage this comprehensive set of tools to continue investigating the `kIOReturnNotResponding` issue and improve development workflow. The memory systems and reasoning tools will be particularly useful for maintaining context across complex debugging sessions.
---
[2025-05-03 14:35:47] - Current Focus: Extracting coherent ASCII strings from DICE registers instead of focusing on the `kIOReturnNotResponding` issue.
[2025-05-03 14:35:47] - Recent Changes: Implemented a new function `extractCoherentRegisterStrings` in utils.cpp that analyzes register values to find and combine meaningful ASCII strings. The function successfully identified the device name "Venice" in the register data, even though it was split across bytes.
[2025-05-03 14:35:47] - Open Questions/Issues: Are there other useful data patterns in the register values that could be extracted? Could this approach be extended to identify other device-specific information like channel configurations or clock sources?
---
[2025-05-03 14:53:18] - Current Focus: Improving the channel name detection in the scanner tool to extract more meaningful information from the device.
[2025-05-03 14:53:18] - Recent Changes: Enhanced the channel name detection by fixing endianness issues and improving regex pattern matching. Modified the code to search for patterns in combined text rather than individual registers. Added a comprehensive summary section that provides a clear overview of all detected channels. Successfully identified 24 mono output channels, 24 mono input channels, 4 stereo output pairs, and 4 stereo input pairs, for a total of 64 I/O channels in the Venice device.
[2025-05-03 14:53:18] - Open Questions/Issues: How can we use this channel configuration information to improve the DICE driver implementation? Are there other device-specific configurations we should extract from the registers?
---
[2025-05-03 14:55:05] - Current Focus: Using the channel configuration information to improve the DICE driver implementation.
[2025-05-03 14:55:05] - Recent Changes: Analyzed the DiceAudioDevice implementation to understand how TX/RX information is currently handled. Identified key components: FireWireDevice struct stores txStreamCount and rxStreamCount; DiceAudioDevice class has member variables m_nb_tx, m_tx_size, m_nb_rx, and m_rx_size; initIoFunctions method reads these values from device registers; getTxNameString and getRxNameString methods read channel names.
[2025-05-03 14:55:05] - Open Questions/Issues: How can we integrate the channel name information from the scanner into the DiceAudioDevice implementation? Should we create a new method to read and parse the channel names from the alternate memory location we discovered?
---
[2025-05-03 15:03:35] - Current Focus: Improving the firewire_scanner tool to make channel configuration discovery more dynamic and accurate.
[2025-05-03 15:03:35] - Recent Changes: Created a comprehensive plan to improve the scanner tool. The plan addresses four main issues: 1) Making channel configuration discovery more dynamic by implementing dynamic address discovery and improving channel name extraction; 2) Removing duplicated logic by creating common utilities for string extraction; 3) Improving RX/TX register reading by making stream count detection more dynamic and adding validation; 4) Addressing unreasonable channel counts by improving regex patterns and adding cross-validation.
[2025-05-03 15:03:35] - Open Questions/Issues: How do we determine the correct maximum number of channels per stream for different DICE chip types? How do we handle devices with non-standard channel naming conventions? Should we implement a more sophisticated algorithm for detecting the end of channel lists?
---
[2025-05-03 15:09:23] - Current Focus: Implementing the scanner improvement plan, starting with the common string extraction utility and dynamic channel names address discovery.
[2025-05-03 15:09:23] - Recent Changes: Implemented the StringMatch struct and extractStringsFromMemory function to provide a common utility for string extraction. Implemented the discoverChannelNamesAddress function to dynamically discover the address where channel names are stored. Added the validateChannelNumbers function to check if channel numbers are sequential and within reasonable limits. Modified the exploreChannelNamesArea function to use these new utilities, making it more robust and dynamic.
[2025-05-03 15:09:23] - Open Questions/Issues: Should we implement cross-validation between channel names and stream information next? How can we improve the regex patterns to handle different channel naming conventions? Should we add more potential addresses to the discoverChannelNamesAddress function?
---
[2025-05-03 15:23:44] - Current Focus: Fixing bugs in the string extraction code to improve the reliability of channel name detection.
[2025-05-03 15:23:44] - Recent Changes: Fixed a critical bug in the byte-level string extraction where a variable 'c' was being referenced outside its scope. Improved the logic to properly handle both byte orders (little-endian and big-endian) when extracting strings from registers. The scanner now correctly identifies and displays both quadlet-level and byte-level strings, providing a more comprehensive view of the device's channel configuration.
[2025-05-03 15:23:44] - Open Questions/Issues: What's the next step in the scanner improvement plan? Should we focus on improving the RX/TX register reading or implementing cross-validation between channel names and stream information? How can we use the improved string extraction to better understand the device's capabilities?
---
[2025-05-03 15:26:25] - Current Focus: Fixing the channel name duplication issue in the scanner tool.
[2025-05-03 15:26:25] - Recent Changes: Identified a bug in the channel name detection code where the same channel names are being reported multiple times. Created a detailed plan (memory-bank/channel-name-deduplication-plan.md) to fix the issue by using sets instead of vectors to automatically deduplicate the channel names.
[2025-05-03 15:26:25] - Open Questions/Issues: Should we also improve the regex patterns to be more specific? Should we add more validation to ensure the channel numbers are reasonable? After fixing the duplication issue, what's the next priority in the scanner improvement plan?
---
[2025-05-03 15:32:25] - Current Focus: Moving on to the next steps in the scanner improvement plan after successfully fixing the channel name duplication issue.
[2025-05-03 15:32:25] - Recent Changes: Successfully implemented the channel name deduplication fix by modifying the exploreChannelNamesArea function in utils.cpp to use std::set instead of std::vector for storing channel names. Also improved the calculation of total stereo channels to use the number of unique channel numbers rather than dividing the total number of stereo channel names by 2. The scanner now correctly reports unique channel names without duplicates.
[2025-05-03 15:32:25] - Open Questions/Issues: What's the next priority in the scanner improvement plan? Should we focus on improving the RX/TX register reading or implementing cross-validation between channel names and stream information? How can we extract more coherent bits from the registers to better understand the device's capabilities?
[2025-05-03 16:41:10] - Current Focus: Integrating new register reading functions into `src/tools/scanner/dice_helpers.cpp`.
[2025-05-03 16:41:10] - Open Questions/Issues: Unable to apply diff to `src/tools/scanner/dice_helpers.cpp` due to persistent formatting errors in the diff content. Need to investigate the cause of the diff application failure.
