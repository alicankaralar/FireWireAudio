[2025-05-03 08:08:53] - Completed debugging firewire_scanner for DICE base address discovery. Identified 0xFFFFF0000000 via Config ROM key 0xD1. Blocked by kIOReturnNotResponding (-536838121) on reads in this range. Next: External research on error.
[2025-05-03 08:15:21] - New Task: Refactor src/tools/firewire_scanner.cpp into smaller files (<250 lines) within a new src/tools/scanner/ directory. Remove redundant code (bruteforce scan, getDeviceGuid). Update CMakeLists.txt.
[2025-05-03 08:43:06] - Completed refactoring of firewire_scanner into src/tools/scanner/. Build successful. Removed old src/tools/firewire_scanner.cpp.
[2025-05-03 12:59:59] - Completed debugging of Config ROM parsing logic in `src/tools/scanner/config_rom.cpp`. Correct DICE base address is now discovered.
[2025-05-03 14:16:03] - Added MCP servers to Roo Code environment: browser-tools, browser-use, and sequential-thinking. These servers provide additional capabilities for browser interaction and sequential thinking.
[2025-05-03 14:17:10] - Successfully tested the sequential-thinking MCP server by analyzing the DICE chipset issue through a structured thinking process. The server is working correctly and will be useful for complex problem-solving tasks.
[2025-05-03 14:20:54] - Added additional MCP servers to Roo Code environment: filesystem, github, git, playwright, fetch, apple-tools, desktop-commander, slack, brave-search, and xcodebuild. These servers provide a comprehensive set of tools for file operations, version control, browser automation, API access, and more.
[2025-05-03 14:26:25] - Added more specialized MCP servers: firecrawl (web scraping), puppeteer (browser automation), context7 (context management), knowledge-graph and memento (memory systems), think-tank (reasoning), web-research and deep-research (web search and analysis), ollama (local LLM integration), and graphlit (knowledge graph tools).
[2025-05-03 14:35:29] - Implemented a new feature in the firewire_scanner tool to extract coherent ASCII strings from DICE registers. Added `extractCoherentRegisterStrings` function to utils.cpp that analyzes register values to find and combine meaningful ASCII strings that may span across multiple registers or be stored at the byte level. Successfully identified the device name "Venice" in the register data.
[2025-05-03 14:52:50] - Enhanced the channel name detection in the scanner tool by fixing endianness issues and improving regex pattern matching. Modified the code to search for patterns in combined text rather than individual registers. Added a comprehensive summary section that provides a clear overview of all detected channels. Successfully identified 24 mono output channels, 24 mono input channels, 4 stereo output pairs, and 4 stereo input pairs, for a total of 64 I/O channels in the Venice device.
[2025-05-03 14:56:17] - Created a comprehensive plan for integrating the channel configuration information into the DICE driver implementation. The plan includes new methods for reading channel names from the alternate memory location, categorizing channels, exposing channel information through the API, and calculating channel counts. This will enable the driver to accurately represent the device's channel configuration, improving routing capabilities and user experience.
[2025-05-03 15:03:55] - Developed a detailed plan to improve the firewire_scanner tool to make channel configuration discovery more dynamic and accurate. The plan addresses four main issues: 1) Making channel configuration discovery more dynamic by implementing dynamic address discovery and improving channel name extraction; 2) Removing duplicated logic by creating common utilities for string extraction; 3) Improving RX/TX register reading by making stream count detection more dynamic and adding validation; 4) Addressing unreasonable channel counts by improving regex patterns and adding cross-validation between channel names and stream information.
[2025-05-03 15:09:01] - Implemented the first part of the scanner improvement plan. Created a common string extraction utility (extractStringsFromMemory) that can find both quadlet-level and byte-level strings in memory. Implemented dynamic channel names address discovery (discoverChannelNamesAddress) that tries several potential addresses and looks for channel name patterns. Added channel number validation (validateChannelNumbers) to check if channel numbers are sequential and within reasonable limits. Modified the exploreChannelNamesArea function to use these new utilities, making it more robust and dynamic.
[2025-05-03 15:21:19] - Fixed bugs in the string extraction code. Resolved an issue with the byte-level string extraction where a variable 'c' was being referenced outside its scope. Improved the logic to properly handle both byte orders (little-endian and big-endian) when extracting strings from registers. The scanner now correctly identifies and displays both quadlet-level and byte-level strings, providing a more comprehensive view of the device's channel configuration.
[2025-05-03 15:31:52] - Fixed channel name duplication issue in the scanner tool. Modified the code to use sets instead of vectors for storing channel names, which automatically deduplicates them. Also improved the calculation of total stereo channels to use the number of unique channel numbers rather than dividing the total number of stereo channel names by 2. The scanner now correctly reports unique channel names without duplicates.
[2025-05-03 16:40:58] - Attempting to integrate new register reading functions into `src/tools/scanner/dice_helpers.cpp`. Encountering repeated failures when applying diff due to formatting issues.
[2025-05-03 16:46:07] - Completed analysis of firewire_scanner tool modules, explained multiple read operations per device, deleted redundant utils.cpp and utils.hpp, and fixed duplicate definitions in DiceDefines.hpp.
[2025-05-04 01:08:41] - Fixed format on save functionality by installing clang-format via Homebrew and updating VSCode settings to explicitly point to the clang-format executable. Also disabled Prettier for C/C++ files to avoid conflicts and enabled "Fix All" code actions on save.
[2025-05-04 01:11:55] - Updated .clang-format to place commas on the left as requested by the user. Added settings to control comma placement, including BinPackArguments: false, BinPackParameters: false, BreakBeforeInheritanceComma: true, BreakConstructorInitializersBeforeComma: true, and BreakBeforeBinaryOperators: All.
[2025-05-04 01:12:55] - Updated .clang-format to disable alignment of consecutive assignments and declarations. Changed `AlignConsecutiveAssignments` and `AlignConsecutiveDeclarations` from `true` to `false` to prevent aligning every `=` on each line as requested by the user.
[2025-05-04 01:16:35] - Updated .clang-format to achieve specific function argument formatting style. Added settings to format function arguments with each argument on its own line and significantly indented, including `AllowAllArgumentsOnNextLine: false`, `AllowAllParametersOfDeclarationOnNextLine: false`, and `ContinuationIndentWidth: 60`.
[2025-05-04 01:18:00] - Updated formatting settings to preserve whitespace and indentation. Added `files.insertFinalNewline: true` and `files.trimFinalNewlines: false` to VSCode settings, and `KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks: true` and `MaxEmptyLinesToKeep: 2` to .clang-format to ensure spaces are not trimmed on newlines and to include the same amount of space as the indent level.

[2025-05-04 01:20:25] - Updated .clang-format to match the provided example code style. Changed BasedOnStyle from Google to LLVM and added spacing settings to match the example, including SpacesBeforeTrailingComments, SpacesInParentheses, SpacesInSquareBrackets, SpacesInAngles, SpaceInEmptyParentheses, SpaceBeforeParens, SpaceBeforeRangeBasedForLoopColon, SpaceBeforeInheritanceColon, and SpaceBeforeAssignmentOperators.

[2025-05-05 02:09:42] - Verified that `src/tools/scanner/io_helpers.cpp::readQuadlet` already implements Strategy A (using `ReadBlock` for high addresses >= 0xFFFFF0000000). No code changes required for this task.
*   [2025-05-06 00:23:00] - Update Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) with synthesized information from DICE docs, `ref/dice.c`, `ref/libhitaki`, and `ref/libffado`.

[2025-05-05 22:42:20] - Completed refactoring of DICE base address discovery logic in `src/tools/scanner/dice_helpers.cpp`. Extracted logic into helper functions, replaced `std::cerr` with logging, added robustness checks, and cleaned up `readDiceRegisters`.
