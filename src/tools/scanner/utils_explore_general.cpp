// This implementation file now serves as a thin wrapper around the refactored
// modules. All functionality has been moved to memory_explorer.cpp and
// register_string_analyzer.cpp.

// No additional code needed as the header includes the necessary modules
// and all functions are now defined in those modules.

// No implementation needed here as all functionality has been moved
